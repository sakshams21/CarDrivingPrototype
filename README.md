Welcome to the Unity Car Physics Prototype repository! This project serves as a starting point for creating realistic car physics in Unity. Whether you're a game developer looking to implement driving mechanics or a curious learner exploring vehicle physics, this prototype can be a valuable resource.

## ✨ Features

- 🏎️ Arcade car physics simulation(Inspired from [Crew 2](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-crew/the-crew-2)).
- 🎮 Simple and customizable vehicle controller.
- 🌄 Terrain and obstacle collision detection.
- 📹 Smooth camera follow for a better driving experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3+ (You can download Unity [here](https://unity.com/).)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sakshams21/unity-car-physics-prototype.git`
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Open the `CarScene` scene.
4. Play the scene to experience the car physics prototype.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys (or your preferred input) to control the car.
- Experiment with the Custom Car Controller to customize the car's behavior.
- Study the code and physics settings to understand how the car mechanics are implemented.

## To-Do List 📝

### Core Driving Mechanics 🚗

1. **Vehicle Physics**: Refine and enhance the suspension(Currently it does not work well with bumps)

2. **Steering and Controls**: Implement responsive and intuitive steering controls, ensuring an enjoyable driving experience.

3. **Drifting Mechanics**: Add drifting mechanics to enhance gameplay and allow players to perform exciting maneuvers.

### Environment and Gameplay 🌍

4. **Track Generation**: Create mostly F1 Circuits.

5. **Points System**: To implement *Near Miss* feature.

### Visual and Audio Enhancements 🌟

6. **Graphics**: Improve visual quality with better textures, lighting, and post-processing effects to make the game visually appealing.

7. **Engine Sounds**: Implement engine sounds with proper gear shifts.

### User Interface and Feedback 📊

8. **HUD**: Create an informative heads-up display (HUD) that provides essential information, including speed, distance, and lap times.

9. **Feedback System**: Add visual and audio feedback for collisions, speed boosts, and other in-game events to provide a more immersive experience.
