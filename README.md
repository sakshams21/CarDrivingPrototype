Welcome to the Unity Car Physics Prototype repository! This project serves as a starting point for creating realistic car physics in Unity. Whether you're a game developer looking to implement driving mechanics or a curious learner exploring vehicle physics, this prototype can be a valuable resource.

## Features

- Arcade car physics simulation(Inspired from [Crew 2](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-crew/the-crew-2)).
- Simple and customizable vehicle controller.
- Terrain and obstacle collision detection.
- Smooth camera follow for a better driving experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3+ (You can download Unity [here](https://unity.com/).)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/unity-car-physics-prototype.git`
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Open the `CarScene` scene.
4. Play the scene to experience the car physics prototype.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys (or your preferred input) to control the car.
- Experiment with the Custom Car Controller to customize the car's behavior.
- Study the code and physics settings to understand how the car mechanics are implemented.
